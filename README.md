Contains the creative stuff I have written while reading Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman

All the code has been written in Processing 2.2.1 (If not stated otherwise.)

## Repo structure

Each folder contains a single example that can be executed from the `FOLDERNAME.pde` file using Processing.

To see what an example produces, just click on the folder. Every folder contains a README.md that shows an animation of the output of the code.
